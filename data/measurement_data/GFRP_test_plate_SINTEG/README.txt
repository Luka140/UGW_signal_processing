Plate layup
"2x E-glass Q1600 [0/pm45/90]
 2x UD1200 [0]
 2X E-glass Q1600 [0/pm45/90]"
Total thickness: 6 mm

Distances:
CH4 is wired into the device...
actuator - CH1: 18mm
actuator - CH2: 58mm
actuator - CH3: 98mm

sample rate: 1 MHz

time scale is microseconds
[0-~800]
if you have the right sample rate, you should see a peak at 60khz
