-Note im not sure whether 0 is actually 0 or 90, so these may be rotated by 90 deg

These measurements are taken in the supposed 0 direction

Distances:
CH4 is wired into the device...
actuator - CH1: 18mm
actuator - CH2: 58mm
actuator - CH3: 98mm

sample rate: 1 MHz

time scale is microseconds
[0-~800]
if you have the right sample rate, you should see a peak at 60khz

In this set of measurements, the plate was elevated by putting some folded paper under the four corners.
Measurements are taken in the 'floating' region
