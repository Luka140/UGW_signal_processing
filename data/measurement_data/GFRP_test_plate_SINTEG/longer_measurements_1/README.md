-Note im not sure whether 0 is actually 0 or 90, so these may be rotated by 90 deg

This was measured on perceived direction 0 

Distances:
CH4 is wired into the device...
actuator - CH1: 18mm
actuator - CH2: 58mm
 -> actuator - CH3: 182mm

sample rate: 1 MHz

time scale is microseconds
[0-~800]
if you have the right sample rate, you should see a peak at 60khz

Transducers:
4x S1802 DPC shear transducer

Tx Settings: 60kHz 3 pulses
