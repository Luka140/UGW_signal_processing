2mm alu plate. SINTEG setup 120khz 3 pulses.

In this experiment I have three s1802 shear transducers in the cage:
0 mm (tx) - 58 mm (CH1) - 98 mm (CH2)

I then have an S1803 longitudinal transducer at ~100mm distance from the tx

For this measurement, line from Tx to S1803 will be perpendicular to the cage.

That means that for this experiment, the S1803 is inline with the the S1802 connector.
