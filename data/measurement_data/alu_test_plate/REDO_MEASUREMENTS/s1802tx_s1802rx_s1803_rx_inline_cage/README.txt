2mm alu plate. SINTEG setup 120khz 3 pulses.

In this experiment I have three s1802 shear transducers in the cage:
0 mm (tx) - 58 mm (CH1) - 98 mm (CH2)

I then have an S1803 longitudinal transducer at ~100mm distance from the tx

For this measurement, the S1803 will be in line with the cage, 
on the opposite side as CH2 from the tx. 

That means that for this experiment, the S1803 is located perpendicular to the S1802 connector.
